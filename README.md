# Simple Android Architecture

this library is focusing on how to develop simple.

this library achieves the belows.
1. Simple to read : even non-developer can understand
2. Simple to write : no boilerplate code, 1 line of code means 1 business logic. able to focus on business logic only
3. Simple learning curve : easy to remember usage. even it's easy, if you forget?, you can find where to see. and also it provides the sample as well.
4. Simple to use latest architecture : you don't need to spend a lot of time for what is latest architecture, how to make good code. just follow sample, then you'll write code at least not bad.
5. Simple to test : it provides base test classes and sample. just follow sample, then you can test.
