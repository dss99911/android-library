/**
 * TODO: migrate to SharedFlow when 1.4.0-M1-native-mt is released
 *  - All is covered by SharedFlow so, [DataFlow] is not required anymore
 *  - seems to add extension `val value: T?` and returns null if data not yet emitted
 *      - Reason
 *          - UI requires data at initial time to draw UI
 *          - but data not exists. so have to define initialValue
 *          - but need to decide which side set initialValue. viewModel side? or view side?
 *          - before decision, we have to consider event data.
 *              - event should be handled only when data is received.
 *              - if there is initialValue, we always have to ignore initialValue. and initialValue is not always null. but can be different value. so, view side always should know what is initialValue.
 *          - so, initialValue should be decided on View side.
 *          - we can say that Event and just Data is different. and make different field on ViewModel
 *              - but, same data can be used for event and data both. so the flow on ViewModel should support both
 *  - map to Resource with try catch is required
 *      - There is mention 'SharedFlow never completes'. but it doesn't means collect still working. when exception occurs, collect is not working.
 *      - seems to have to use MutableSharedFlow for retry on Error feature.
 *      - resourceFlow { } also required
 *
 *
 * =================== As it'll be migrated to SharedFlow, no need to read below. but explained why DataFlow was required===================
 * If I knew that SharedFlow support all. I wouldn't make DataFlow. ðŸ˜¢
 *
 * Flow on ViewModel !!Experimental!!
 * This is similar to LiveData. but difference is that setValue type is T instead of T?
 *
 * TODO
 *  - There are various operator because there is conversion among Flow, DataFlow, ResourceFlow.
 *  - this should get simpler.
 *  - Focus on the frequently used use case
 *
 * Reason to use [DataFlow] instead of [MutableStateFlow] (no. 4 is the biggest reason)
 * 1. Initial time value can not be empty. if the data should be fetched asynchronously, there can not be the data
 * 2. StateFlow is distinct.
 *   - There are two cases on view side.
 *      - event and state
 *      - event is like navigation. it should be called whenever value is set(but StateFlow doesn't emit if data is same)
 *      - state is like setting data on composable, it's not required to update if data is same.
 *      - one data can be used as event and state both. so it should be decide on View side, instead of ViewModel or Model
 *          (if logically distinct is required, we will do it on Model or ViewModel. but I'm talking about UI side data)
 * 3. [MutableStateFlow] is interface
 *  - as [MutableStateFlow] is Interface, xcode recognize value as Any.
 *  - if it's class, it's recognize as defined type
 * 4. it's difficult to use [map] operator from [StateFlow] to [StateFlow]. as [StateFlow] contains initial value, whenever use map, we have to add code to ignore empty value by developer as only developer knows that it's empty data or not.
 *
 * Characteristics
 * 1. on initial time, value can be empty(easy to handle empty case when use the data)
 * 2. getValue always nullable. as initial value is able to be empty(handle empty value on UI side)
 * 3. if value is not possible to be empty in context. use !! or set initialValue on UI side
 * 4. not distinct
 * 5. [mapData] operator to transform data and return value is [DataFlow]
 *    - as [DataFlow] can be collected by multiple collector, transforming between [Flow] to [DataFlow] should be independent from Collector's coroutine context.
 *    - so, use different [CoroutineScope]
 *    - TODO limitation : it's difficult to cancel transforming, as it's running in different scope.
 * 6. resource repeatable : normal flow can emit only from flow block. but by setValue, it's possible to retry same process
 *    - repeating is available by [Resource.retry]
 *    - when retry() is invoked, [DataFlow.repeat] is called or first resourceFlow block is repeated
 *    - so, if there are multiple transforming, [Resource.retry] calls last [DataFlow]'s repeat()
 *    - the below sample code show where the retry happen.
 *    val first = dataFlow(scope) {
 *      emit(1)
 *      emit(2)
 *    }
 *    first.map {
 *      it * it
 *    }.toDataFlow(scope) // when retry() called, this DataFlow.value is repeated.
 *    .mapToResource {
 *      api.getResult(it) // this api will be called with DataFlow's last value.
 *    }.mapResource {
 *      "result : $it"
 *    }.collect {
 *      it.retry()
 *    }
 *
 *    //or you can repeat whole process by the below
 *    first.repeat()
 * 7. ResourceFlow's Error or Loading can contains data if there was previous data
 * 8. when ResourceFlow start, Resource.Loading is emitted.
